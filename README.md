Full-Stack Product Dashboard Deployment Guide
This guide explains how to package the React frontend and FastAPI backend into a single Docker image and deploy it to a free hosting service.

1. Project Structure
To use the provided Dockerfile, you must organize your project into the following structure. Place your existing React application code inside the frontend directory.

/product-dashboard-project
|
|-- Dockerfile          # The Docker configuration file (provided)
|
|-- /backend/           # Folder for your backend code
|   |-- main.py         # The FastAPI application (provided)
|   |-- requirements.txt# Python dependencies (provided)
|
|-- App.jsx             # Your React App.jsx file.
                        # In a real project, this would be a full /frontend folder
                        # with src, public, package.json etc.


Note: The Dockerfile assumes your main React component is App.jsx. In a real-world scenario with a full Vite/CRA project, you would copy the entire project into the frontend directory and the Dockerfile would copy the relevant sub-directories (src, public, package.json, etc.).

2. Building the Docker Image
Once your files are structured correctly, you can build the Docker image.

Open your terminal and navigate to the root of your project (/product-dashboard-project).

Run the build command:

docker build -t product-dashboard .

docker build: The command to build an image from a Dockerfile.

-t product-dashboard: This tags (names) your image product-dashboard.

.: This tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

3. Running the Docker Container Locally
After the build is complete, you can run the container on your local machine to test it.

docker run -p 8000:8000 product-dashboard

docker run: The command to run a container from an image.

-p 8000:8000: This maps port 8000 on your host machine to port 8000 inside the container.

product-dashboard: The name of the image you want to run.

Now, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see your React application running, served by the FastAPI backend.

4. Deploying to a Free Hosting Service
Here are some excellent services that offer a free tier for deploying Docker containers. They typically work by connecting to your GitHub repository.

Recommended Services:
Render:

Why: Very user-friendly with a straightforward setup for Docker containers. The free tier is generous enough for small projects and personal portfolios.

How: Create a new "Web Service" on Render, connect your GitHub repository, and point it to your Dockerfile. Render will automatically build and deploy your image.

Fly.io:

Why: Offers a generous "always free" tier that includes a small VM, storage, and a shared IPv4 address. Great performance as it deploys your app on servers physically closer to your users.

How: You'll use their command-line tool (flyctl) to deploy. After installing it, run fly launch in your project directory, and it will detect your Dockerfile and guide you through the deployment process.

Google Cloud Run:

Why: Extremely powerful and scalable. It has a perpetual free tier that includes a generous number of requests and CPU time per month. It's a "pay-for-what-you-use" model, so if your app has low traffic, it remains free.

How: You first need to push your Docker image to Google Artifact Registry and then create a Cloud Run service from that image. This is more complex than Render but offers greater scalability.

Deployment Steps (General):
Push your project to GitHub: Create a new repository on GitHub and push all your files (Dockerfile, backend/, App.jsx, etc.).

Sign up for a hosting provider: Choose one from the list above (Render is recommended for beginners).

Connect your GitHub account: Authorize the hosting service to access your repositories.

Create a new service: Follow the provider's instructions to create a new web service/app, selecting the repository you just created.

Configure the build: Ensure the provider is set to build from your Dockerfile.

Deploy! The service will pull your code, build the Docker image, and deploy it to a public URL.
